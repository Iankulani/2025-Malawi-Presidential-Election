# 2025-Malawi-Presidential-Election

2025 Malawi Presidential Election Integrity repository is an open-source civic-tech platform developed to support free, fair, transparent, and credible elections in Malawi, scheduled for 16 September 2025. 
This project is inspired by the events of the 2019 election, which was nullified due to widespread irregularitiesâ€”causing national unrest, economic disruption, and loss of lives.

This repository is not affiliated with any political party or government body. It is purely a citizen-centered initiative focused on democratic integrity. 
Our system is built using cutting-edge blockchain technology to ensure that every vote is immutable, traceable, and transparent. 
Blockchain ensures real-time verification, decentralized storage, and tamper-proof records, offering voters and observers confidence in the results.

We also integrate advanced statistical models and data science techniques to validate election results in real-time, detect anomalies, and analyze voting patterns across regions. 
Our dashboard includes interactive charts, geographic heatmaps, and historical comparisons to educate citizens and stakeholders on the electoral landscape and performance.

A key feature of the tool is the enforcement and monitoring of the "50% +1 vote threshold", a constitutional requirement for presidential victory in Malawi. 
The system continuously evaluates candidate performance to confirm if this threshold has been met, and automatically flags run-off requirements if necessary.

The platform includes a real-time monitoring system that aggregates results from polling centers, broadcasts verified data, and supports citizen reporting to detect irregularities or malpractice.

This project is open-source, transparent, and driven by civic responsibility. Any financial support or donations are welcomed and appreciated to help us cover hosting, data access, development, outreach, and training costs. 
Transparency is our foundation, and all contributions will be publicly disclosed.
